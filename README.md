# DataPlotStudio

DataPlotStudio is a GUI implementation of the Matplotlib and pandas data analytics and plotting capabilities. 
It is written using the PyQt6 GUI framework.
The program is built up of two primary functionality:
* A data driven tab where you can view, edit, manipulate and alter data based primarily on the pandas library and embedded tools.
* A plotting interface where you can plot your data, as well as tweaking the plot in a graphical environment primarily based on the matplotlib.pyplot functionality. A backend for the plotly plotting library is implemented as well.

## Requirements
If you wish to build the application from source, a requirements.txt is provided. To install with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
