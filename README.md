# DataPlotStudio

DataPlotStudio is a GUI implementation of the Matplotlib plotting and pandas data analytics capabilities. 
The program is built up of two primary interfaces:
* A data driven tab where you can view, edit, manipulate and alter data based primarily on the pandas library and embedded tools.
* A plotting interface where you can plot your data, as well as tweaking the plot in a graphical environment based on the Matplotlib's `pyplot` functionality.


## Features
* Import data from files: csv, Microsoft Excel, text files, JSON and GeoSpatial fileformats (shp, GeoPackage, GeoJSON)
* Import data from Google Sheets documents and from SQLite, PostgreSQL and SQL databases
* Edit and manipulate your data visually using tools from pandas and embedded custom tools
* View statistics about your data
* Plot the data with 30 different available plot types using Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Interactively design and customize your plots
* Add custom plotting code using the integrated Python editor to augment the your data visualization even further
* Export data and Python code to share or use in other tools
