FEATURES
- When exiting application. the user should be prompted/warned about not having had their project saved. If the user just saved the project, the no prompt/warning should appear. 
- Allow the user to specify Display units for the axis values. eg. Hundreds, Thousands etc
- Standard Error errorbars should applicabale to all plots, not only scatter.








LONG TERM FEATURES
- Add 3D plotting
- Add the ability to create subplots or multiple plots in the canvas view
- Add a small terminal? where the user can input custom code to alter the plot in their own way. Similarly in datatab for the same reasons. Security is important. The user should not be able to write unintended code.hmm.



UI FIXES and improvements
- Make changes to visibility of certain features when a certain plot_type is selected. [ONGOING]
- Move figure settings into General [NOT A PRIORITY]
- General UI looks 
- When the user uses the filter and they want to create a new filter. The user has to "RESET to ORIGINAL" before they can apply a new filter. I would like to change this so when the user clicks "Apply Filter" again. then it uses the original_df as reference [MAYBE]



BUGS:
IMPORTANT_BUGS:
- When using the plot_subset in the Manage subset dialog. the dialog just closes without redirectiing to the plottab.
- When the user adds many columns to aggregate by, the window gets stretched to screen limit and the user cannot click the "Apply Aggregation" button. The dialog should be stretched, but only to an extent.







LESS IMPORTANT_BUGS:
- When plotting a chart. The x_ticks are not automatically conforming to the datas size, when the xaxis labels are categorical
- Icon for "Export Data" is not loaded


MAJOR BUG




CODE
- The plot_tab.py is very long and i feel as if it would work better if the file is split into two. One file that handles UI components and another that handles functionality and logic. The split would happend at the end of the function def _create_splitter(self, left, right) -> QSplitter: function. I have a version now with a split UI and logic class for the plot tab. Needs to test many things rn. The old code is still in desktop and on Notepad++
