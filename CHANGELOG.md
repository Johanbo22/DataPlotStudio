- Issues with slow table scrolling and slow plot rendering when using large datasets. Now using a cache system to store information about the plot. If the changes are styling based, the dataframe is not read again, instead cache data is used.
- Bug where coloraxis and color legends for geospatial plots was not parsed correctly and would either not show up or create duplicates.
- Bug where the data table on a plot was duplicated each time the placement parameter was changed. Caused multiple of the same table to be plotted.
